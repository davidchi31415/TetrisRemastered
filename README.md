This is a project I made back in high school. It's Tetris but recreated using Gamemaker Studio 2. 
The files here are only the executables, but the source code was written using GML (Gamemaker Language). 

# Game Mechanics

## Objective: 
Tetrominoes (groups of 4 block letters) spawn. Last as long as you can by preventing them from reaching the top. 
Every time you fill an entire line, it gets deleted and you earn points. Once it reaches the ceiling, you lose.

## Controls to play the game:
* Either A/D or Left/Right arrow keys: move Tetrominoe left or right
* Either W/S or Top/Bottom arrow keys: rotate Tetrominoe clockwise or counterclockwise
* Press and hold control: soft drop (makes Tetrominoe go down faster)
* Space: hard drop (immediately goes to floor/thing)

## Credits:
The music used is not mine. Credits go to the following videos:

Obviously, I am not the original creator of Tetris. That title goes to Alexey Pajitnov.
